    <h1>takoyaki</h1>

    <h2>step1:</h2>
    <img src="step11.jpg" alt="cdgscvghav">
    <p>When the hot plate appears to be hot enough to bake the takoyaki, spill a little bit of the batter to hear that sizzling sound, and then pour the batter over the hot plate as evenly as you can. We got the employee to do this part for us.</p>

    <h2>step2:</h2>
    <img src="step22.jpg" alt="rugvrusv">
    <p>You can put in the tenkasu (crunchy bits of deep-fried flour batter), and the red pickled ginger as much, or as little, as you’d like. Even if you get ahead of yourself and (or just unintentionally) put a lavish amount of it in, it should end up alright in the end.</p>

    <h2>step3:</h2>
    <img src="step33.jpg" alt="00000000">
    <p>The star-appearance at this takoyaki-making show belongs to the takopin, the special eyeleteer designed for turning takoyaki over and over again to bake it evenly.</p>

    <h2>step4:</h2>
    <img src="step44.jpg" alt="11111111">
    <p>First, use the takopin to gather the splattered dough to the center of a ball, and to separate the balls one from another.</p> 
    
    <h2>step5:</h2>
    <img src="step55.jpg" alt="22222222">
    <p>That was the preparing-for-battle procedure and now comes the time to show off your takoyaki baking skills! At this point, there is no room for amateurs and weaklings – only those who aren’t afraid to tackle this risky business, and who have the full-on confidence about their swift arm, are allowed to enter the battle ring. The only advice we can give you is to aim for a 90degree turn first, and then to turn it all upside down (the ball, not the hot plate) so that the batter flows down to form a perfectly round ball. Or something like that.</p>
    
    <h2>step6:</h2>
    <img src="step66.jpg" alt="33333333">
    <p>But even if the shape is somewhat uneven, or you tried to turn a half-runny, not-yet-baked takoyaki, and it seems hopeless at the moment, don’t worry – if you keep rolling it up and down tirelessly, it’ll eventually appear roundish and ball-like. Actually, it might be even more enjoyable to just keep rolling it and turning it around for the fun of it – using your takoyaki-awakened sixth sense.</p>

    <h2>step7:</h2>
    <img src="step77.jpg" alt="44444444">
    <p>Look, even poor, untalented persons such as us, the writers, miraculously managed to make it look like a proper takoyaki!

        There are countless cases when a person from Osaka gets a takopin handed over, with much-obliging words, “Here, you’re from Osaka, you must be an expert!” But, unbelievable as it may sound, there are still people from Osaka with wooden fingers who just can’t manage takoyaki-turning all that gloriously. Do have some pity on them, please.</p>

    <h2>step8:</h2>
    <img src="step88.jpg" alt="55555555">
    <p>And finally, let us pour some sauce and mayonnaise over top, and decorate it all with some aonori (green dried seaweed) and golden hanakatsuo (dried bonito flakes). You’ll find two types of sauce available for use – the one labeled with red is quite spicy, so be warned before you put too much of that one on top.</p>

    <h2>step9:</h2>
    <img src="step99.jpg" alt="666666666">
    <p>Voila! It’s done, and believe us, it tastes all the better when you think about how you prepared it all by yourself (or, in our case, with a little help of professionals, as well).</p>
